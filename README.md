## Project Structure
Little if any source code should ever be put in the root of the repository. Homework assignments will be organized like
this:

    homework/<assignment>/<problem>/<source code, etc.>

For each homework assignment, I will create a new folder under "homework". Within that folder, there will be
subdirectories for individual problems. This organization ensures that the source code, audio files,
images, etc. for a given problem are neatly grouped together in our source tree. This organization can be tweaked
if several problems are closely related and share assets and/or code.
